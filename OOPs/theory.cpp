// C++ What is OOP?
// OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

// Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

// Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

// OOP is faster and easier to execute
// OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
// OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
// OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

// C++ Classes/Objects
// C++ is an object-oriented programming language.

// Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

// Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".

// A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
